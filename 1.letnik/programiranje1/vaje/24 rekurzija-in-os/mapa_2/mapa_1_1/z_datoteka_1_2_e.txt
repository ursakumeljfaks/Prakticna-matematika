Gob is unhappy.

Again? I tried to include him.
I gave him a job.

- You gave him a letter to mail.
- Don't tell me that was too much for him.

No, Michael, he mailed the letter.
That's not the point.

<i>Gob had not mailed the letter,
but, in an act of defiance...</i>

<i>dramatically hurled the letter
into the sea.</i>

<i>This proved a more difficult dramatic
gesture than he'd anticipated.</i>

- So what do you want me to do about it?
- Don't take that tone.

He's my son.
I want you to make him stop calling me.
